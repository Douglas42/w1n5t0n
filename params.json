{"name":"W1n5t0n","tagline":"A memorial to Daniel Bulow, aka Doni, aka w1n5t0n","body":"#A Tribute To Daniel Bulow (w1n5t0n)\r\n\r\n![Doni and Doug](/img/w1n5t0n_and_doug.jpg)\r\n\r\nDouglas: Everything in the visible universe is composed of atoms formed in stars. From all reaches of the cosmos, they come together in brief and beautiful moments, forever entwined with space and time. Doni serves to remind us of our noble origins. A beautiful beacon in an infinite lineage of stars.\r\nAs many of you know, Doni wasn't a religious person. In honor of Doni's memory, I would like to offer you the best consolations that physics can afford. The First Law of Thermodynamics tells us that energy is neither created nor destroyed. It is infinite in its extent and motion, transferred between all beings, all mass, all matter composing the universe. Doni's energy is not gone. He is always with us, and always has been with us. Every quanta of energy, all the particles whose paths were interrupted by his smile, by the touch of his hands, hundreds of trillions of particles now translated into memory that will forever redefine us, all of us honored to have known him.\r\n\r\n![Doni and his Grandfather](/img/grandpa_and_doni.jpg)\r\n\r\nxMonsterx (Brandon): Doni was my best friend. Not my best friend online, not my best friend at the moment, my best friend. Period. I loved him as a friend, and as much as a brother. He was a gift to the world, a brilliant mind, gone too soon. He was a mentor to some, a friend to many, and an amazing person to all. My only regret is that he is gone so soon, and if I could do anything to change that, I would. Rest in peace, my friend.\r\n\r\n![Doni and Tyler](/img/tyler_and_doni.jpg)\r\n\r\nMudkipith: Daniel Bulow....\r\n\r\nIm sorry i wasn't there for you,  \r\nwhen you needed help the most,  \r\nI respected and admired you,  \r\nI read your every Post,  \r\nYou were my friend, my teacher,  \r\nand i loved you like a brother...  \r\nBorn to be a genius,  \r\nyou programmed like no other...  \r\n\r\nSo as this talents gone to waste,  \r\nMy salty tears, i can taste,  \r\nIll miss our chats, and your teachings too,   \r\nRest In Peace Winston...  \r\nI will not forget you.  \r\n\r\nRIP Dani....\r\n\r\nyour OLD friend...\r\nMud\r\n\r\n![Doni at Graduation](/img/w1n5t0n_grad_1.jpg)\r\n\r\nNeo_95: Really wish I had gotten to know you better bro, but we can't go on regretting.\r\n\r\nwe're saddened by your departure but this is the time to celebrate your life, share\r\nstories, and remember the times we had with you :)\r\n\r\nI Hope to meet you in another life, but untill then, Rest In Peace my brother, love.\r\n\r\n![W1n5t0n throwing his cap](/img/w1n5t0n_grad_2.jpg)\r\n\r\nMegaByte: I really wish I could have gotten to know Doni better.
