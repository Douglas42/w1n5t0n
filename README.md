Douglas: As many of you know, Doni wasn't a religious person. I would like to offer you the best consolations that physics can afford. The First Law of Thermodynamics tells us that energy is neither created nor destroyed. Rather, it merely moves, transferred between all beings, all mass, all matter composing the universe. Doni's energy is not gone. In the strictest physical terms, he is always with us, and always has been with us.
Everything in the visible universe is composed of atoms, and any element heavier than lithium was created in the heart of a star. Doni served to remind us of our noble origins. Atoms swarm throughout the universe and momentarily come together to create you and me, and when we die they do not cease to exist. They are the building blocks that beget the next generation of stars, forever cosmically entwined.
The law of conservation of energy and mass tells us that everything that was Doni is still here. Every quanta of energy ejected from his body as heat has been absorbed by our eyes, all the particles whose paths were interrupted by his smile, by the touch of his hands, hundreds of trillions of particles not translated into memory that will forever redefine us, all of us honored to have known Daniel Bulow. Doni is not gone from this universe, he will always be with here in a more disorderly state.
